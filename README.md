# Kiiten-app
An app to allow me to weigh my newly born foster kittens. 
This does not directly get the mass of the kittens it was just a simpler less step way to input data into a google sheets file. 
Everything works on this how i want it to on my PC however compiling this to Apk did not work for me.
This a Python Script

#Kitten-App-MK2 
I am currently using android studio to create a new app that should work about the same way.
I am excited to use Android studio so i can apply Java programming.
